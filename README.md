# Tap_Counter
Tap Counter is a 2D game developed using Unity3D Game Engine and C# Language. It's a simple game to get familiar with Unity3D.

Developing Game via Unity3D , I practically learned lots of concept oof OOPs(object Oriented Programming). 
Since, everything i was doing in the code was via functions and Methods

Thanks to Youtube(Farhaan Aqeel) helping me t develop my very First Game.
